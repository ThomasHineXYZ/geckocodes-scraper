GeckoCodes Scraper
------------------

Simple scraper for [Gecko Codes](https://www.geckocodes.org/) that you can either run manually or run scheduled with something like CRON. It does take a while to download / update all of the codes, but just let it be and it will work.

This is a *Python 3* script and requires that you either have Python 3 installed as `python` or be able to run `python3` on your system.

### Required Libraries:
* BeautifulSoup4
