GeckoCodes Scraper
------------------

Update: [See below](#Closure-of-GeckoCodes)

Simple scraper for [Gecko Codes](https://www.geckocodes.org/) that you can either run manually or run scheduled with something like CRON. It does take a while to download / update all of the codes, but just let it be and it will work.

This is a *Python 3* script and requires that you either have Python 3 installed as `python` or be able to run `python3` on your system.

# Required Libraries:
* BeautifulSoup4

# Closure of GeckoCodes
On October 5, 2020 [GeckoCodes](https://geckocodes.org/) was closed down with only this showing on the front page:
```
GeckoCodes.org
August 2009 - October 2020

When I launched GeckoCodes.org it was my hope to put control of your work into your own hands. Up until then, game hacking sites were managed by volunteer admins and moderators and a game hacker had to go through them to add/remove/or update their work.
I believe GeckoCodes was successful in handing that power over to the hackers.

Through the many years since then though, GeckoCodes has fallen out of service and missed out on critical PHP and MySQL updates while the community on GameHacking.org grew and the features that made GeckoCodes important were adopted in their much larger all-consoles database. New hackers almost never got added in the last few years of GeckoCodes.org while GameHacking.org has kept their doors open to all.

To keep the promise of letting you manage your own work, and to unite the community under one (much larger) roof, your work will be merged into the GameHacking.org database with credit maintained. Once that processes is complete, you can sign up and continue to manage your work as you wish. It's still your work, and it's still in your control. It's just part of a bigger family now. <3

Thanks for the fun memories,

Because of this, this project has been archived. I might come back and upload the codes to this project as I have a dump of their code files from October 4, 2020 at 4am PST.
